				<!--<p> Welcome my friends/family/admirers! If you are not already aware, this is a website dedicated to yours truly, Aijalon Kathlyn Kilpatrick. However, the reason I created this page was to test my HTML/CSS abilities. I decided to make the webpage about me because I couldn't think of any other topic. <em> (Wow, humble, right?) </em> Hopefully, you are enjoying what you see, but if not, please tell me and I'll see what I can do to make your viewing experience better. </p> -->

				<p> I was born August 26, 2000 in Lancaster, California. I live with my mother, father, brother and sister; their names are Vanetta, Morris, Jadon, and Jada, respectively. Since my mom was in the Air Force, I moved six times  and have attended seven different schools between Kindergarden and 12th grade. I have  lived in California, Florida, Virginia, and Colorado. Our final move was to Lithia, Florida, which is about 30 minutes east of Tampa. </p>
