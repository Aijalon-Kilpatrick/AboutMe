                <h2> Intro </h2>
				<p> We, the Kilpatricks, are a family of 5. We are made up of a mother, a father, a pair of fraternal twins, and a daughter. We have moved multiple times due to our family's association with the military. All three kids are in high school and participate in a wide range of extracurriculars. The parents have stable jobs in technology and business. We bond through card games, movie night, and road trips. Our most recent and final move was to Florida.
