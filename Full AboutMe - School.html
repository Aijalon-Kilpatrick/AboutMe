				<p> Welcome my friends/family/admirers! If you are not already aware, this is a website dedicated to yours truly, Aijalon Kathlyn Kilpatrick. However, the reason I created this page was to test my HTML/CSS abilities. I decided to make the webpage about me because I couldn't think of any other topic. <em> (Wow, humble, right?) </em> Hopefully, you are enjoying what you see, but if not, please tell me and I'll see what I can do to make your viewing experience better. </p>

				<p> Let me start at the beginning. I was <strong>born August 26, 2000 </strong> in Lancaster, California. I live with my <strong> mother, father, brother and sister</strong>; their names are Vanetta, Morris, Jadon, and Jada, respectively. Since my mom was in the Air Force, I moved six times  and have attended seven different schools between Kindergarden and 12th grade. I have  lived in California, Florida, Virginia, and Colorado. Our final move was to Lithia, Florida, which is about 30 minutes east of Tampa. </p>

We have moved multiple times due to our family's association with the military. All three kids are in high school and participate in a wide range of extracurriculars. The parents have stable jobs in technology and business. We bond through card games, movie night, and road trips. Our most recent and final move was to Florida.

				<h3> Music </h3>
<!-- Pic of each band/singer-->
				<p> I don't just play music, I like to listen to it as well. I enjoy many musical genres including southern rock, alternative rock, and indie pop. Here are my top band and favorite songs. </p>

				<h4> Alabama Shakes </h4>
				<p> Alabama shakes is a southern rock band wiht a charismatic frontwoman, Brittany Howard. Their albumns are <i> Boys & Girls </i> and <i> Sound & Color. </i> My favorite hits from Alabama Shakes are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Rise to the Sun </li>
					<li> Sound and Color </li>
					<li> Future People </li>
				</ul>

				<h4> Borns </h4>

				<h4> Glass Animals </h4>
				<p> Glass Animals is an indie rock band from England, but their style can been described as psychedelic and pop too. They have released two albums named <i> Zaba </i> and <i> How to be a Human Being. </i> My favorite hits from Glass Animals are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Gooey </li>
					<li> Take a Slice </li>
					<li> Hazey </li>
				</ul>

				<h4> Portugal. The Man </h4>
				<p> It is hard to give a description of Portugal. The Man. They have changed their sound every album, and that's one of the reasons I love them so much. While their most popular song comes from the hit single <i> Feel it Still </i>, they have released 8 albums since 2006, some of which include <i> American Ghetto </i>, <i> Evil Friends </i>, and <i> Woodstock </i>. Here are my top pics from Portugal. The Man:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> So Young </li>
					<li> Got It All </li>
					<li> Smile </li>
					<li> Dead Dog </li>
					<li> Mornings </li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4> The Revivalists </h4>
				<p> The Revivalists are yet another southern rock band that I adore.

				<h3> STEM/SNHS </h3>
				
				<!-- <img src = "https://www.madriverschools.org/cms/lib03/OH01914812/Centricity/Domain/498/STEM.jpg" alt= "A S.T.E.M banner that spells out Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics." width= "400">

				<p> I am involved with the STEM club and SNHS club at my school. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In this club, we can take part in a variety of different activites that include the following: MOSI science bowl, Water Towers, Robotics, Bridge Building, and Science Olympiad (Regional and State). I myself have done bridge building and science olypiad, and I will continue with these activities through my senior year. In addition to those two activities, I will be doing robotics and MOSI Science bowl this year. <!--STEM club is one of my favorite clubs because I can build bridges and towers or teach myself how to investigate a crime scence. --> </p>
				
				<!-- insert image of Stem team-->
				
				<p> Here is a more detailed description of the activities I do in STEM Club: <br/> <br/></p>
				
				<h4> Bridge Building </h4>
				Students work in a group of 2 to 3 to make a bridge that can hold the greatest amount of weight. For the past two years I have worked with a close friend on this event. We would work at least two times a week for 1-2 hours planning, taking measurements, cutting wood, and gluing the pieces together. Some setbacks we faced include the bridge weighing too much, running out of glue, cutting the wood incorrectly, and my friend's dog stepping on the bridge putting us way behind schedule. Although my friend and I would make many mistakes while making our bridge, the end product has always been something for us to be proud of. The reason I participate in bridge building is I love trying to find the best solution for a task. Whenever we had to completely change the blueprints of our bridge, I never felt frustrated. Rather, I was excited that we were getting closer to the making the best bridge possible.

				<h3> Band </h3>
				
				<p> I originally started off playing the cello in fourth grade, but when I moved to Colorado, the middle school only had a band. That is how I picked up the trumpet. I have been playing the trumpet for 6 years now. I consistently rank in the top four out of 16 to 18 trumpets at my high school. The Newsome High School Band is a well structured organization. We have a marching band, three concert bands, a jazz band, two winter gaurd teams, and an indoor percussion.</p>
