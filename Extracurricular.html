				<h3> S.T.E.M. </h3>

				<p> I am involved with the STEM club and SNHS club at my school. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In this club, we can take part in a variety of different activities that include the following: MOSI science bowl, Water Towers, Robotics, Bridge Building, and Science Olympiad (Regional and State). I myself have done bridge building and Science Olympiad, and I will continue with these activities through my senior year. In addition to those two activities, I will be doing robotics and MOSI Science bowl this year. STEM club is one of my favorite clubs because I can build bridges and towers or teach myself how to investigate a crime scence. </p>

				<h4> Bridge Building </h4>
				Students work in a group of 2 to 3 to make a bridge that can hold the greatest amount of weight. For the past two years I have worked with a close friend on this event. We would work at least two times a week for 1-2 hours planning, taking measurements, cutting wood, and gluing the pieces together. Some setbacks we faced include the bridge weighing too much, running out of glue, cutting the wood incorrectly, and my friend's dog stepping on the bridge putting us way behind schedule. Although my friend and I would make many mistakes while making our bridge, the end product has always been something for us to be proud of. The reason I participate in bridge building is I love trying to find the best solution for a task. Whenever we had to completely change the blueprints of our bridge, I never felt frustrated. Rather, I was excited that we were getting closer to the making the best bridge possible.
				</p>
				
				<h4> Science Olympiad </h4>

				<p> Science Olympiad is a big event for STEM Club. 15 kids compete in 23 science based events. There is a regional competition, and the top three teams advance to the state competition. We have gone to states for the past three years. The events I participated in last year, 2017, were Forensics, Awesome Aquifers, and Microbe Missions. For Forensics, me and a friend analyzed crime scene evidence and took a test to determine who committed a crime. We had to demonstrate our knowledge of aquifers through a test and creating a model for Awesome Aquifers. Microbe Missions was a test on microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, prions, etc. Science Olympiad was a fun way of being exposed to many topics I may not of learned about in school.

				<h3> Clubs </h3>

				<p>
					I have been in many clubs Throughout my time at high school, but the following are clubs that I enjoy most and bring me the most happiness. While these clubs are sponsored by the school, very little time is spent on clubs during school hours. Most clubs require a commitment during students' free time. 
				</p>

				<h4> Honor Societies </h4>

				<p>
					 Honor societies recognize hard-working students at the national level. To be in one, You must meet and maintain certain academic standards and complete a required amount of tutor hours.  I have been in SNHS (Science National Honor Society) since junior year and MA&Theta; (Mu Alpha Theta) since senior year. Mu Alpha Theta is the national math honor society. To be in Mu Alpha Theta, you must maintain a 3.5 GPA in your math classes and a 3.0 GPA overall. Throughout the year we tutor, compete in math competitions, and help with school events. Similar to MA&Theta;, Science National Honor Society (SNHS) requires each student to maintain a 3.5 GPA in their science class and a 3.0 GPA overall. SNHS does many of the same activities that MA&Theta; does, and hosts tutor sessions for its members to mentor their peers. Some of the school events both clubs have done in the past are Relay for Life and Trick or Treat Street. <!--  Does SNHS do Relay for Life -->Relay for Life is an event to raise money to fund solutions for cancer related issues. Trick or Treat Street provides the opportunity for young kids to have a safe Halloween experience all the while going to creative booths made by clubs at Newsome High School. I have completed 25+ hours of volunteering or tutoring in both honor societies combined.
				</p>

				<h4> Archery </h4>
				<p>
					Joining Archery Club was one of the best decisions I have made. I have always wanted to try a new sport, and archery sounded like my best option. I like the idea of learning something totally new and building that skill up from scratch. I have also met a group of interesting kids that make practice all the more intriguing. Archery Club meets 2 or 3 times after school to practice shooting and learn technique. The club also does many fundraisers, like Relay for Life, and compete in a State competition. I participated in the state competition last year and placed 10th for 11th grade girls. I hope to compete again this year and hopefully earn a better score.
				</p>

				<h4> Reading Club </h4>
				<p>
					Reading Club involves a lot more than just reading. We do the Million words challenge, Blind Date with a Book, Dr. Suess Day, and Relay for Life.  The Million Words challenge is open for our members to attempt and0 requires the participant to read a million words throughout the year. Blind Date with a Book takes place in February, and it allowes people to check out a book without knowing anything about it. On Dr. Suess Day, we go to an elementary school to read to kids. In the past, the Reading Club partnered with the Writing Club to form a Relay for Life team. On top of all that, we choose a book to read for the month until our next meeting and discuss with each other all things related to books.

				<h3> Band </h3>
				
				<p> I originally started off playing the cello in fourth grade, but when I moved to Colorado, the middle school only had a band. That is how I picked up the trumpet. I have been playing the trumpet for 6 years now. I consistently rank in the top four out of 16 to 18 trumpets at my high school. The Newsome High School Band is a well-structured organization. We have a marching band, three concert bands, a jazz band, two winter guard teams, and an indoor percussion.</p>
				
				<h4> Marching Band </h4>
				<p> Marching band is one of my biggest activities in the fall. It can take up 6 to 13 hours a week on average. Some of the things we do in marching band includes rehearsals, personal practice, Band Camp, Competitions, football games, and exhibitions. Big events the band has done are as follows: FMBC State Championships, Bands of America Regional Competition, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and regional competitions. I have played the first trumpet part since sophomore year.				
				</p>
				
				<h4> Concert Band </h4>
				<p> Concert band is a class that I take in school, but there are so many events that happen outside of school hours that I will count it as an extracurricular activity. I have been fourth trumpet in the top ensemble since sophomore year. In tenth grade I got into All County Band and was nominated for, and participated in, the University of South Floridaâ€¯Festival of Winds honor band. I did Festival of Winds junior year too. I achieved a superior rating on a solo or duet for Solo & Ensemble in 9th, 10th, and 11th grade. I am currently preparing a grade 5 solo for the upcoming Solo & Ensemble event in February.

				<h3> Volunteering </h3>

				<p>
					I have volunteered for many different activites, but working at the library has been my main focus. Overall, I have 150+ volunteering hours and I am constantly racking up more hours. When I had the opportunity to do community service, the first place I thought of to complete those hours was the library. I am a book fanatic at heart, so the library is one of my favorite places. It only made sense for me to give back to a place that has greatly influenced my life.
				</p>

				<h4> Bloomingdale Library </h4>
				<p> I have done many different volunteer activities since I have been in high school. However, I have completed the most hours at the Bloomingdale Regional Library. Responsibilities include shelving books, cleaning computers and tables, answering questions, and helping with library events. Some library events that I have helped with are a Harry Potter themed summer camp and the Bloomingdale Giveback. The Giveback involves knitting, crocheting, and sewing items to donate to organizations like Meals on Wheels, Newborns in need, and senior homes. I mostly knit, but I do crochet occasionally. I have made scarves, hats, and pouches, and I am currently working on a baby blanket. Working at the library is one of my favorite things to do. I think libraries are an integral part to the community. They provide so many important programs for people, so I thought why not help out by volunteering. </p>
