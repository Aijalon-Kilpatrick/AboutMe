			<h2> Books </h2>
			<p> Reading is a fun past time for me. I get to travel to worlds different from ours and meet characters unlike any people I know. I could make and endless list of the many books that I love, but I'll stick with the books that got me into reading, my favorite stand alone books, my favorite series, and my favorite comic books. </p>
			
			<article>

				<h4> My First Books </h4>
				<p> Here are just a couple of books that started my reading journey. After being exposed to these books, I started seeing reading as a fun pastime as opposed to a chore. Also, the authors of these books have consistently put out great work and I keep up with most of their new stories.  </p>
				<ul>
					<li><em> A to z Mysteries </em>Ron Roy</li>
					<li><em> Encyclopedia Brown </em>Donald J. Sobol</li>
					<li><em> Return of the Homework Machine </em>Dan Gutman</li>
					<li><em> Swindle </em>Gordon Korman</li>
				</ul>

				<h4> Stand Alone Books </h4>
				<p> It was actually pretty difficult to find stand alone novels that I have read since everything needs a sequel these days. <em> * sigh * </em> But here are some great books that did not have a sequel at the time I was writing this. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><em> Cell </em>Stephen King</li>
					<li><em> Misery </em>Stephen King</li>
					<li><em> Schooled </em>Gordon Korman</li>
					<li><em> Ungifted </em>Gordon Korman</li>
				</ul>

				<h4> Books Series </h4>
				<p> The following list contains a wide range of stories, but all have left me with a satisfied feeling. From vampires to Egyptian demigods, these series have taken me on great adventures. I've even read a few of them twice. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><em> Cirque du Freak </em>Darren Shan</li>
					<li><em> Genius Files </em>Dan Gutman</li>
					<li><em> Magnificent 12  </em>Michael Grant</li>
					<li><em> The Kane Chronicles </em>Rick Riordan</li>
				</ul>

				<h4> Comic Books </h4>
				<p> I have only recently got into reading comic books, but I sure am glad that I did. You can get as compelling of a story from a comic as you can from a regular novel, plus you get amazing graphics to go along with the story. My favorite comic book author is Brian K. Vaughan. It took all my will power not to list every comic of his I have read. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><em> Saga </em>Brian K Vaughan </li>
					<li><em> Y: The Last Man </em>Brian K Vaughan</li>
					<li><em> Locke and Key </em>Joe Hill</li>
					<li><em> Lumberjanes </em>Grace Ellis; Shannon Watters</li>
				</ul>
